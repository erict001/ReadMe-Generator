# ReadMe Generator
    
    ## Description
    To help better create ReadMe files in the future
    I built this project for an assignment in UW Coding Bootcamp to help us use npm's and Node.js
    Creating a simplified ReadMe file for every homework assignment. This file will help generate a more substantive ReadMe file for every assignment.
    I learned how to call npm's and use their packages to help generate a more robust javascript file.

    ## Installation
    Open up the terminal code in the index.js file. Run: "npm init -y" to open up a package.json file. Then run "npm i inquirer" to download inquirer to your local computer.
    Make sure that node.js is installed on your computer. To check if it's properly downloaded, enter "node -v" into your terminal window in your VS code. 
    Open up the ReadMe-Generator file and type in "node index.js" into your terminal file. 
    Fill out all of the prompts that you choose to. When the console displays "Success!" your ReadMe is generated. To view your ReadMe, open the "README.md" file
