# ReadMe Generator
    
    ## Description
    To help better create ReadMe files in the future
    I built this project for an assignment in UW Coding Bootcamp to help us use npm's and Node.js
    Creating a simplified ReadMe file for every homework assignment. This file will help generate a more substantive ReadMe file for every assignment.
    I learned how to call npm's and use their packages to help generate a more robust javascript file. 
    
    I had some challenges in getting the hyperlinks to show up. I went to the Github docs page and the code that I provided on lines 12-15 are correct but not sure why they aren't showing up. Also, I wasn't able to figure out the badge at the top of the page. Overall I am happy that I learned how to use Node.js while implenting npm's. I think this will help serve me in the future. If I have time this weekend, I will continue to work on getting the hyperlinks to become operational and add a badge at the top of the screen.

    ## Installation
    Open up the terminal code in the index.js file. Run: "npm init -y" to open up a package.json file. Then run "npm i inquirer" to download inquirer to your local computer.
    Make sure that node.js is installed on your computer. To check if it's properly downloaded, enter "node -v" into your terminal window in your VS code. 
    Open up the ReadMe-Generator file and type in "node index.js" into your terminal file. 
    Fill out all of the prompts that you choose to. When the console displays "Success!" your ReadMe is generated. To view your ReadMe, open the "README.md" file
